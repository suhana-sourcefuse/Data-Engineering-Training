# Task 4: Banking System with Error Handling

This project is a continuation of the earlier banking application. It supports:

## Features
- Add users (case-insensitive)
- Add transactions (credit/debit)
- View all transactions
- Delete specific transactions
- View user balance
- Error handling using `try-except`
- Input validations (e.g., positive amount, valid transaction type)

## File Structure
- `banking.py` – Main Python script containing all logic
- `README.md` – Project overview and usage instructions
- `.gitignore` – Ignores unnecessary files
- `requirements.txt` – List of Python dependencies (if any)

## How to Run
1. Open terminal inside the `task4` folder.
2. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python banking.py
